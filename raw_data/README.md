# Data Preprocessing

## Introduction
Before the raw data can be used in the simulation study, it must undergo preprocessing. This involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing the data to make it suitable for the study.

## Steps

1. Open the Jupyter notebook named `Preprocess_Hamilton_Raw.ipynb` found in the scripts directory.

2. Run all cells in the notebook. This will execute the preprocessing operations on the raw data.

3. After processing, new data files are generated and automatically stored in the data folders of each respective simulation directory.

This ensures that the data is in the correct format and is readily available for the simulation stage of our study.
